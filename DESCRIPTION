Description: Various mRNA sequencing library preparation methods generate
    sequencing reads specifically from the transcript ends. Analyses that
    focus on quantification of isoform usage from such data can be aided
    by using truncated versions of transcriptome annotations, both at the
    alignment or pseudo-alignment stage, as well as in downstream
    analysis. This package implements some convenience methods for readily
    generating such truncated annotations and their corresponding
    sequences.
